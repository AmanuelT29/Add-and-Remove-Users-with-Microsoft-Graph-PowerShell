# Add and Remove Users with MicrosoftGraph PowerShell

## Platform and Tools Used

## Objective
In this project, I will demonstrate how to create and delete user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Specifically, I will:

- Create three new users: **Mitu, Mimi, and Eyoel**.

- Verify their successful creation.

- Delete the newly created users using Graph PowerShell commands.

This project showcases basic user lifecycle operations using Microsoft Graph PowerShell, useful for scripting and automating identity management tasks.
